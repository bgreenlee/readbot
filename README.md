# ReadBot

ReadBot is a Slack bot that makes it easy to save books and articles to your
Goodreads and Pocket accounts.

## Usage

First, connect your accounts:

```
/readbot connect goodreads
/readbot connect pocket
```

Then add the `bookmark` reactji to any message containing a supported link (currently Amazon.com for books, or any other link for Pocket), and it will be saved to your account.
